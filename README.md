# Self-Driving Car using Deep Q-Learning

This repository contains the code for a self-driving car implementation using Deep Q-Learning. The goal of the project is to train an autonomous agent to navigate and make decisions in a simulated driving environment.

## Introduction

In this project, we utilize the Deep Q-Learning algorithm to teach a virtual car how to drive in a simulated environment. The agent learns to make decisions based on the input received from sensors and strives to maximize its cumulative reward.
